Homework and projects for CS4620 - Compilers

D5
-------------
To see my tests run for Alex Hutcheson's (amh4bm) D4 assignment:
        ```
        cd compilers/jdk2pq/D5/compilers/amh4bm/src/
        ```
        ```
        make turtle
        ```
        ```
        make tests_jdk2pq
        ```

All tests will produce a syntax errors. All tests can be found in
        ```
        compilers/jdk2pq/tests/D5_tests/
        ```
